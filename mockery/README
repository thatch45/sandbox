Mockery is a general tool for generating installed coppies of Arch,
The idea is like combining the functions of debootstrap and vmbuilder
or mock and thincrust.

The goal is twofold really, and the two functions are so closely related.
And Arch is pacage manager autonomous, so you don't need an installer to install it,
just pacman.

so mockery will make chroots in a "basic" mode, and vm images in an advanced mode.
