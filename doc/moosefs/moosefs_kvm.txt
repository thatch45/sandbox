Using KVM in MooseFS with Libvirt
=================================

The holy grail of virtual machine cloud deployments is reliable, fast and big
shared network storage. Shared storage is what makes the private cloud world
go round.

So the question of what shared storage method to use is a serious one. If the
organization has unlimited IT money and wants to put all of the eggs in one
basket, choose a large SAN. Otherwise the choice is in the realm of a
distributed network file system.

The choices are vast, but after considerable investigation, the choice was
clear, MooseFS.

With MooseFS deploying virtual machines in the cloud has been smooth, and the
distributed nature of MooseFS has allowed for seemless growth, and in some
situations, seemless reduction.
